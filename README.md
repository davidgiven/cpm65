CP/M-65
=======

What?
-----

This is a native port of Digital Research's seminal 1977 operating system CP/M
to the 6502. So far it runs on:

  - The BBC Micro family, including Master, Tube, and Electron; TPA ranges from
    14kB on the Electron to 57kB on the Tube.

  - Commodore 64; TPA is 46kB.
  
  - Commodore VIC-20; TPA is 24kB.

  - Commodore PET 4032, 8032 and 8096; the TPA ranges from 25kB to 57kB on the
    8096.

  - Commander X16; TPA is 46kB.

  - Apple IIe; TPA is 46kB.

  - Atari 400/800 XL/XE; 16kB minimum; TPA ranging from 8.5kB up to over 49kB
    on a 64kB XL/XE machine.

  - Oric 1 and Oric Atmos (but not, currently, the Telestrat) with Microdisc
    interface; TPA 44kB.

  - Sorbus homebrew 6502-based computer.
  
  - Olimex' neo6502 6502-based computer.

  - KIM-1 with K-1013 FDC, fully expanded RAM.

Unlike the original, it supports relocatable binaries, so allowing unmodified
binaries to run on any system: this is necessary as 6502 systems tend to be
much less standardised than 8080 and Z80 systems. (The systems above all load
programs at different base addresses.)

Currently you can cross-assemble programs from a PC, as well as a working C
toolchain with llvm-mos. For native development, there's a basic assembler, a
couple of editors, a BASIC, and a byte-compiled Pascal subset and interpreter.
You need about 20kB to run the assembler at all, and of course more memory the
bigger the program.

No, it won't let you run 8080 programs on the 6502!

Why?
----

Why not?


Where?
------

It's [open source on GitHub!](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65)


How?
----

You have two options:

  - [Download a binary
    release.](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65/releases/tag/dev) You can then
    copy this onto a disk for booting on a real machine, or use it in an
    emulator.

  - or build it yourself.

To build it, you will need the [llvm-mos](https://llvm-mos.org) toolchain.
CP/M-65 support is available out of the box. Once installed, you should just be
able to run the Makefile and you'll get bootable disk images for the Commodore
64 (with 1541 drive) and BBC Micro (producing a 200kB SSSD DFS disk):

    make LLVM=<your llvm-mos bin directory here>/ -j$(nproc)

Building CP/M-65 is a bit of a performance because it's aggregating lots of
other software, all of which need building in turn. You'll need: a C and C++
compiler, cc1541 (for creating 1541 disk images), cpmtools (for creating CP/M
disk images), libfmt (all the C++ tools use this), python3 (for the build
system), and FreePascal (because the MADS assembler is written in Pascal). Use
these Debian packages:

    cc1541 cpmtools libfmt-dev python3 fp-compiler srecord

There are also automated tests which use `mame` to emulate a reasonable number
of the platforms, to verify that they actually work. To use this, install
`mame`, and then run `scripts/get-roms.sh` to download the necessary system
ROMs. Then do:

    make LLVM=<your llvm-mos bin directory here>/ -j$(nproc) +mametest

You can add `+all` to that if you want to do a normal build and run the tests at
the same time.

### BBC Micro notes

  - To run, do SHIFT+BREAK.

  - Alternatively, if you're on a Tube system, do:

    ```
    MODE 3
    *!BOOT
    ```

  - Alternatively alternatively, if you're on a Master system, do:

    ```
    MODE 131
    *DISK
    *!BOOT
    ```

  - It'll autodetect the amount of available memory. If you're _not_ on a Tube
    or Master system with shadow RAM, then your screen mode will consume TPA
    space. On a stock BBC Micro it _will_ run in mode 0, but you'll only get a
    2.5kB TPA! Mode 7 will work better here. It will work on the Electron, but
    you'll have to use mode 6 which will leave you 14kB of TPA. That's
    unfortunately not enough to run the assembler.

  - The CP/M file system is stored in a big file (called cpmfs). This will
	  expand up to the size defined in diskdefs: currently, 192kB (the largest
	  that will fit on a SSSD disk). All disk access is done through MOS so you
	  should be able to use a ramdisk, hard disk, Econet, ADFS, VDFS, etc. If so,
	  you'll want to define your own disk format and adjust the drive definition
	  in the BIOS to get more space.

  - The BBC Micro port has a SCREEN driver.

### Commodore 64 notes

  - Load and run the `CPM` program to start.

  - It's excruciatingly slow as it uses normal 1541 disk accesses at 300 bytes
	  per second. Everything works, but you won't enjoy it. At some point I want
	  to add a fastloader.

  - The disk image produced is a hybrid of a CP/M file system and a CBMDOS file
	  system, which can be accessed as either. The disk structures used by the
	  other file system are hidden. You get about 170kB on a normal disk.

  - Disk accesses are done using direct block access, so it _won't_ work on
	  anything other than a 1541 (but it should be straightforward to add
	  support for other drives). Sorry.

### VIC-20 notes

  - See the Commodore 64 above.

  - You need a fully expanded VIC-20 with all memory banks populated, for the
    full 35kB.

  - You get a 40x24 screen, emulated using a four-pixel-wide soft font. It
    doesn't look great but is surprisingly readable, and is vastly better than
    the VIC-20's default 22x24 screen mode.

  - Disk accesses are slightly faster than the Commodore 64, but only just.
    It's still a miserable experience.

### Commodore PET notes

  - You need a PET 4032, 8032 or 8096 and either a 4040 disk drive or something
    else which supports the same geometry. The disk image is for a 35-track
    SSSD system (I made it with cc1541). Adapting it for other drives should be
    easy.

  - The 4032 is set up for the Graphics Keyboard. The 8032 and 8096 are set up
    for the Business Keyboard. (It would also be trivial to emulate the
    Business Keyboard on the Graphics Keyboard, but that is likely to be
    confusing.)

  - It's much faster than the Comodore 64 --- you can run the assembler in real
    time without having to worry about retirement.

  - It supports drive 0: only.

  - This port runs completely bare-metal and does not use any ROM routines.

  - The PET port has a SCREEN driver.

### Commander X16 notes

  - To use, place the contents of the `x16.zip` file on the X16's SD card. Load
	  and run the `CPM` program to start.

  - The CP/M filesystem is stored in a big file called CPMFS. It needs support
	  for the Position command in order to seek within the file. `x16emu`
	  currently doesn't support this in its host filesystem, so you'll need to
	  use an actual SD card image. (I have a [pull request
	  outstanding](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-emulator/pull/435) to add
	  support. An SD2IEC should work too, as these support the same commands.
	  However a real Commodore disk drive _will not work_.

### Apple IIe notes

  - To use, place the contents of the `appleiie.po` file onto a disk and boot
    it. The disk image has been munged according to ProDOS sector ordering.

  - It supports a single drive on slot 6 drive 1. You need a 80-column card
    (but not any aux memory).

  - This port runs completely bare-metal and does not use any ROM routines.

### Atari 800 XL/XE notes

  - Standard 720 sectors single-sided single-density disk. The first
    track is reserved (18 sectors). The rest contains a standard CP/M 2.2
    filesystem. Boot with BASIC disabled. This one runs on any Atari with
    at least 16kB of RAM.

  - Or a 1MB harddisk image for use with drive emulators like SIO2SD,
    RespeQT, SDrive, AVG Cart etc... You can also mount it off a FAT
    partition with an SIDE2/3 cartridge and boot from there. That's almost
    emulation speed on real hardware. This one comes in two flavors.
    The hd version runs on any Atari with at least 16kB of RAM, the xlhd
    version is tailored for the XL/XE with at least 64kB of RAM. BIOS, BDOS
    and CCP live "under" the Atari OS ROM, which leaves over 49kB of TPA.

  - Console is standard 40x24. It has a SCREEN driver.

  - User area 1 contains loadable fonts and a utility to set a new
    console font (setfnt.com). This consumes at least 1kB of TPA (depending
    on the padding needed for alignment), but shows proper glyphs like curly
    braces and tilde.

  - It also contains a loadable software 80 columns driver called
    ```tty80drv.com```. This will cost you 7kB of TPA for driver code,
    font data, and screen memory. It has a full SCREEN implementation, too.

### Oric notes

  - This disk image is a MFM_DISK format disk as used by Oricutron. (If you need
    a simple sector image, look at `.obj/oric.img`.) You get about 350kB on a
    disk. The CCP, BIOS and BDOS all live in overlay RAM, leaving the entire user
    memory available for programs.

  - If you're trying to run this on an Oric 1, you need the full upgrade to
    64kB (including overlay RAM).

  - Only the Microdisc interface currently works. (It's supposed to work with
    Jasmin too, but with Oricutron it boots but the keyboard is unresponsive, and
    on MAME it boots into BASIC, and I don't know why.) Only the first drive is
    supported. This would be easy to extend if anyone's interested.

  - The console is 40x28. It has a SCREEN driver.

  - The port runs completely bare-metal and does not use any ROM routines.

### Sorbus notes

  - The Sorbus Computer is a simple, open and cheap (<$15) machine to learn
    about the 65(C)02 processor. It combines an original CPU with a Raspberry
    Pi RP2040 microcontroller that implements all the rest (like RAM, I/O, and
    clock).

  - For building a full image, it is also possible to copy the compiled
    binaries into the proper position into the source tree, and just run a
    global build.

  - More info is available here:
    - [Homepage with lightning talk](https://xayax.net/sorbus/)
    - [Source code on github](https://github.com/SvOlli/sorbus)

### neo6502 notes

  - The neo6502 is a W65C02-based computer using emulated hardware implemented
    by a RP2040. This can be programmed with various different firmware packages,
    each emulating a different 6502-based microcomputer. This port is intended for
    the native firmware package for the neo6502,
    [Morpheus](https://github.com/paulscottrobson/neo6502-firmware/wiki). (The
    other ports will work if you install the appropriate emulation firmware
    package.)

  - It is ridiculously fast.

  - To use, unzip the `cpm65.zip` file into the root directory of the USB stick
    or other storage card. Then enter `load "cpm65.neo"` at the prompt. CP/M-65
    will run.

  - To run on the emulator, either load it as above, or boot it directly with
    `neo cpm65.neo@8000 run@8010`.

  - This port uses an emulated BDOS, meaning that it stores its files as FAT
    files on the neo6502's USB stick. Most well-behaved CP/M-65 programs will
    work, but anything which tries to access the raw filesystem won't; such as
    `STAT` or `DINFO`. Files for each drive and user are stored in separate
    subdirectories. All 16 drives are supported (in directories `A` to `O`).

  - Drive `B` (i.e. `/B/` on the storage device) contains some neo6502-specific
    utilitied. This are in no way complete, or documented.

  - The console is 53x30. It has a SCREEN driver.

### KIM-1 with K-1013 FDC notes

  - To run this on an KIM-1, you need an MTU K-1013 Floppy Disk Controller with an
    SSDD 8'' disk (or this [Pico based RAM/ROM/Video/FDC card](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1-programmable-memory-card)) and full RAM upgrade, including the
    0x0400-0x13ff memory hole.

  - To use it, transfer the `diskimage.imd` image to an SSDD 8'' disk (or place it directly onto an FAT or exFAT formatted SD card and assign it to disk0 in the Pico card). Start the KIM-1 in TTY mode, load the `boot.pap` loader program into 0x0200 and execute it.

  - Only 1 disk is supported. Multi-disk is not stable in CP/M-65 yet.

  - Only TTY interface for now, no SCREEN driver.

### KIM-1 with directly attached SD card notes

  - This port uses Ryan E. Roth's [sdcard6502 for the PAL-1](https://github.com/ryaneroth/sdcard6502), which in turn is based on Gerge Foot's [sdcard6502 for Ben Eater's 6502 computer](https://github.com/gfoot/sdcard6502).

  - You'll need and SDHC card of any capacity, only 32MB are used, and a generic Arduino SD card adapter **with 5V to 3.3V conversion**. See the links above for detailed requisites and connection instructions.

  - For the KIM-1, at least a 32KB (56KB recommended) RAM expansion from 0x2000 is required, as well as RAM filling the 0x0400-0x13ff memory hole. The BIOS assumes that at least the required RAM is installed, and checks for extra RAM above 0xA000.

  - Same requisites apply to the PAL-1 and, additionally, the second 6532 expansion board.

  - 1 32MB disk supported.

  - Only TTY interface for now, no SCREEN driver.

### Supported programs

Commands include `DUMP`, `STAT`, `COPY`, `SUBMIT`, `ASM`, `QE` and `BEDIT` plus
some smaller utilities. I'd love more --- send me pull requests! The build
system supports cc65 assembler and llvm-mos C programs. The native assembler
can be used (in emulation) to cross compile programs for CP/M-65.

In the CCP, you get the usual `DIR`, `ERA`, `REN`, `TYPE` and `USER`. There is
no `SAVE` as on the relocatable CP/M-65 system assembling images in memory is
of questionable utility, but there's a new `FREE` command which shows memory
usage.

You also get a port of Altirra BASIC, an open source Atari BASIC clone. This is
called `ATBASIC`. See below for more details.

Pokey the Penguin loves to read your [pull
requests](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65/compare)!

### The assembler

The CP/M-65 assembler is extremely simple and very much customised to work for
the CP/M-65 environment. It operates entirely in memory (so it should be fast)
but it's written in C (so it's going to be big and slow). It's very very new
and is likely to have lots of bugs. There is, at least, a port of the DUMP
program to it which assembles, works, and is ready to play with.

Go read [cpmfs/asm.txt](cpmfs/asm.txt) for the documentation. 

### The BASIC

Altirra BASIC is an open source recreation of the BASIC used on the Atari 8-bit
machines (on which CP/M-65 runs, coincidentally). It has been heavily modified
by me to work on CP/M-65. Anything Atari-related has been removed, including
graphics, sound, etc. In addition, I have extended the error reporting, added
support for case-insensitive keywords (simply because Atari BASIC traditionally
requires upper case but most CP/M-65 platforms don't have caps lock keys!), and
fairly crudely added file I/O support. There is no screen editor. It is (should
be) binary compatible with Atari BASIC, although programs using Atari features
which aren't supported will of course not run.

It is currently rather fragile with a number of known (and, probably, unknown)
bugs. Please [file bug reports](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65/issues/new)!

Atari BASIC is rather different from Microsoft BASIC. Please consult [the user
manual](https://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/Altirra%20BASIC%20Reference%20Manual.pdf).

**Important!** Do not contact the author of Altirra BASIC for anything related
*to the CP/M-65 port! Any bugs are strictly my fault.

### The editors

BEdit is an incredibly simple line editor modelled after a basic interpreter
(command entry, with LOAD, SAVE, LIST, line numbers etc). It's written in
machine code and assembled with the CP/M-65 assembler; you can assemble it
locally if you have a system with 30kB or more TPA. It'll run on all platforms.

Go read [cpmfs/bedit.txt](cpmfs/bedit.txt) for the documentation.

QE is a much less simple vi-inspired screen editor, written in C. it's much
more comfortable to use than BEDIT, but is about five times the size, and will
only run on systems with a SCREEN driver, as noted above (you can also use the
`DEVICES` command to see what devices your system supports).

### The Pascal

Pascal-M is a Pascal subset intended for use on very small machines. It compiles
to bytecode, M-code, which is then run with an interpreter. The compiler is
itself written in Pascal-M and is capable of compiling itself (very slowly).
There is a basic port to CP/M-65.

To use it, you need to use the interpreter, `PINT`, to run the compiler to
compile your program into an OBP file. This is then translated into an OBB file
by `PLOAD` (not written in Pascal!). You can then run the resulting OBB file
with `PINT`. For example:

```
A> PINT PASC.OBB HELLO.PAS HELLO.OBP
A> PLOAD HELLO.OBP HELLO.OBB
A> PINT HELLO.OBB
```

The compiler will also generate a `PROGRAM.ERR` file containing a copy of any
error messages that result from the compilation process.

Sadly, you need at least 36kB of free RAM to run the compiler, and also the disk
images for various systems are full, so it's only included for a few platforms.

Pascal-M is considerably simplified from the full Pascal language, with support
for only 16-bit integers, but it does support records, sets, enumerations,
pointers, nested functions and procedures, etc. Performance isn't brilliant but
it does work. CP/M-65 is very basic, consisting of support for `text` files
using the traditional `assign`/`reset`/`rewrite`/`close` API. You can have as
many open at once as you like but you can't seek inside a file. In addition,
while `new` is supported, there is no `dispose`.

For more information on Pascal-M, see [Hans Otten's
website](http://pascal.hansotten.com/px-descendants/pascal-m/pascal-m-2k1/).
However, do not report bugs on the CP/M-65 port to him --- [file bug reports
here](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65/issues/new) instead.

### Utilities

`bin/cpmemu` contains a basic CP/M-65 user mode emulator and debugger. It'll run
programs on the host environment with an emulated disk, which is very useful for
testing and development. To use:

`./bin/cpmemu .obj/dump.com diskdefs`

Add `-d` at the front of the command line to drop into the debugger --- use `?`
for basic help. It can only access 8.3-format all-lowercase filenames in the
current directory, but you can also map drives. Use `-h` for help.
