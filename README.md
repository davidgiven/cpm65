CP/M-65
=======

What?
-----

This is a native port of Digital Research's seminal 1977 operating system CP/M
to the 6502. So far it runs on:

  - The BBC Micro family, including Master, Tube, and Electron; TPA ranges from
    14kB on the Electron to 57kB on the Tube.

  - Commodore 64; TPA is 46kB.
  
  - Commodore VIC-20; TPA is 24kB.

  - Commodore PET 4032, 8032 and 8096; the TPA ranges from 25kB to 57kB on the
    8096.

  - Commander X16; TPA is 46kB.

  - Apple IIe; TPA is 46kB.

  - Atari 400/800 XL/XE; 16kB minimum; TPA ranging from 8.5kB up to 42kB on a
    48+kB machine.

Unlike the original, it supports relocatable binaries, so allowing unmodified
binaries to run on any system: this is necessary as 6502 systems tend to be
much less standardised than 8080 and Z80 systems. (The systems above all load
programs at different base addresses.)

Currently you can cross-assemble programs from a PC, as well as a working C
toolchain with llvm-mos. For native development, there's a basic assembler and
an even more basic editor. You need about 20kB to run the assembler at all, and
of course more memory the bigger the program.

No, it won't let you run 8080 programs on the 6502!

Why not?


Where?
------

It's [open source on GitHub!](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65)


How?
----

You will need the [llvm-mos](https://llvm-mos.org) toolchain. CP/M-65 support
is available out of the box. Once installed, you should just be able to run the
Makefile and you'll get bootable disk images for the Commodore 64 (with 1541
drive) and BBC Micro (producing a 200kB SSSD DFS disk).

### BBC Micro notes

  - To run, do SHIFT+BREAK.

  - Alternatively, if you're on a Tube system, do:

    ```
    MODE 3
    *!BOOT
    ```

  - Alternatively alternatively, if you're on a Master system, do:

    ```
    MODE 131
    *DISK
    *!BOOT
    ```

  - It'll autodetect the amount of available memory. If you're _not_ on a Tube
    or Master system with shadow RAM, then your screen mode will consume TPA
    space. On a stock BBC Micro it _will_ run in mode 0, but you'll only get a
    2.5kB TPA! Mode 7 will work better here. It will work on the Electron, but
    you'll have to use mode 6 which will leave you 14kB of TPA. That's
    unfortunately not enough to run the assembler.

  - The CP/M file system is stored in a big file (called cpmfs). This will
	expand up to the size defined in diskdefs: currently, 192kB (the largest
	that will fit on a SSSD disk). All disk access is done through MOS so you
	should be able to use a ramdisk, hard disk, Econet, ADFS, VDFS, etc. If so,
	you'll want to define your own disk format and adjust the drive definition
	in the BIOS to get more space.

  - The BBC Micro port has a SCREEN driver.

### Commodore 64 notes

  - Load and run the `CPM` program to start.

  - It's excruciatingly slow as it uses normal 1541 disk accesses at 300 bytes
	per second. Everything works, but you won't enjoy it. At some point I want
	to add a fastloader.

  - The disk image produced is a hybrid of a CP/M file system and a CBMDOS file
	system, which can be accessed as either. The disk structures used by the
	other file system are hidden. You get about 170kB on a normal disk.

  - Disk accesses are done using direct block access, so it _won't_ work on
	anything other than a 1541. Sorry.

### VIC-20 notes

  - See the Commodore 64 above.

  - You need a fully expanded VIC-20 with all memory banks populated, for the
    full 35kB.

  - You get a 40x24 screen, emulated using a four-pixel-wide soft font. It
    doesn't look great but is surprisingly readable, and is vastly better than
    the VIC-20's default 22x24 screen mode.

  - Disk accesses are slightly faster than the Commodore 64, but only just.
    It's still a miserable experience.

### Commodore PET notes

  - You need a PET 4032, 8032 or 8096 and either a 4040 disk drive or something
    else which supports the same geometry. The disk image is for a 35-track
    SSSD system (I made it with cc1541). Adapting it for other drives should be
    easy.

  - The 4032 is set up for the Graphics Keyboard. The 8032 and 8096 are set up
    for the Business Keyboard. (It would also be trivial to emulate the
    Business Keyboard on the Graphics Keyboard, but that is likely to be
    confusing.)

  - It's much faster than the Comodore 64 --- you can run the assembler in real
    time without having to worry about retirement.

  - It supports drive 0: only.

  - This port runs completely bare-metal and does not use any ROM routines.

  - The PET port has a SCREEN driver.

### Commander X16 notes

  - To use, place the contents of the `x16.zip` file on the X16's SD card. Load
	and run the `CPM` program to start.

  - The CP/M filesystem is stored in a big file called CPMFS. It needs support
	for the Position command in order to seek within the file. `x16emu`
	currently doesn't support this in its host filesystem, so you'll need to
	use an actual SD card image. (I have a [pull request
	outstanding](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-emulator/pull/435) to add
	support. An SD2IEC should work too, as these support the same commands.
	However a real Commodore disk drive _will not work_.

### Apple IIe notes

  - To use, place the contents of the `appleiie.po` file onto a disk and boot
    it. The disk image has been munged according to ProDOS sector ordering.

  - It supports a single drive on slot 6 drive 1. You need a 80-column card
    (but not any aux memory).

  - This port runs completely bare-metal and does not use any ROM routines.

### Atari 800 XL/XE notes

  - Standard 720 sectors single-sided single-density disk. The first three
    tracks are reserved (54 sectors). The rest contains a standard CP/M 2.2
    filesystem. Boot with BASIC disabled.

  - Or a 1MB harddisk image for use with drive emulators like SIO2SD,
    RespeQT, SDrive, AVG Cart etc... You can also mount it off a FAT
    partition with an SIDE2/3 cartridge and boot from there. That's almost
    emulation speed on real hardware.

  - Uses the Atari OS boot loader to load both BIOS and BDOS to avoid needing
    Atari DOS 2.0 DOS.SYS which would consumes precious memory and is useless
    afterwards. CCP.SYS is loaded from the CP/M filesystem.

  - Console is standard 40x24 and it uses the Atari OS routines to read the
    keyboard and write to the screen. There are 41728 bytes of TPA memory on
    a 48kB or 64kB machine. Runs on a 400, 800 or 600XL with 16kB, too.

### Supported programs

Commands include `DUMP`, `STAT`, `COPY`, `SUBMIT`, `ASM`, `QE` and `BEDIT`. I'd
love more --- send me pull requests! The build system supports cc65 assembler
and llvm-mos C programs.

In the CCP, you get the usual `DIR`, `ERA`, `TYPE` and `USER`. There is no
`SAVE` as on the relocatable CP/M-65 system assembling images in memory is of
questionable utility, but there's a new `FREE` command which shows memory
usage.

Pokey the Penguin loves to read your [pull
requests](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65/compare)!

### The assembler

The CP/M-65 assembler is extremely simple and very much customised to work for
the CP/M-65 environment. It operates entirely in memory (so it should be fast)
but it's written in C (so it's going to be big and slow). It's very very new
and is likely to have lots of bugs. There is, at least, a port of the DUMP
program to it which assembles, works, and is ready to play with.

Go read [cpmfs/asm.txt](cpmfs/asm.txt) for the documentation. 

### The editors

BEdit is an incredibly simple line editor modelled after a basic interpreter
(command entry, with LOAD, SAVE, LIST, line numbers etc). It's written in
machine code and assembled with the CP/M-65 assembler; you can assemble it
locally if you have a system with 30kB or more TPA. It'll run on all platforms.

Go read [cpmfs/bedit.txt](cpmfs/bedit.txt) for the documentation.

QE is a much less simple vi-inspired screen editor, written in C. it's much
more comfortable to use than BEDIT, but is about five times the size, and will
only run on systems with a SCREEN driver, as noted above (you can also use the
`DEVICES` command to see what devices your system supports).

### Utilities

`bin/cpmemu` contains a basic CP/M-65 user mode emulator and debugger. It'll run
programs on the host environment with an emulated disk, which is very useful for
testing and development. To use:

`./bin/cpmemu .obj/dump.com diskdefs`

Add `-d` at the front of the command line to drop into the debugger --- use `?`
for basic help. It can only access 8.3-format all-lowercase filenames in the
current directory, but you can also map drives. Use `-h` for help.
