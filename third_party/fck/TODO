General
-	Pass cpu sub opts to cc1 (65c816 registers depend on subtype
	for example)
-	Encode storage class into register upper half
-	For reg arg generate a reg for it, and an assign reg localptr offset
-	Remove old install arrangement
-	Package assemblers as FuxixBinTools

1802:
-	Optimizations
	- shift by 8,16,24 l/r unsigned helpers
	- multiply and divide fastpaths with shift
	- peephole for jumps
	- peephole for store/reload of local
	- use plusconst in eqops for add/sub (will need direct helpers
	- use mul/div optimizations also in mul/div/rem of eqops
	- enable registers

Z80:
-	parse arg code from 65C816 but probably just use it to
	deal with reg args as push ix/iy/bc directly (also track some HL
	usage so we can do stuff like ld hl,%d push hl push hl - ditto 808x)
-	track HL ?
-	Option for no IY
-	Some kind of core code hooks for passing platform ops
	so you can specify stuff like -mz80-noiy to target.c and backend.c
-	Move work back over to fuzix tree and check size of pass 2

Z8:
-	CCONLY (enables stuff like decw testing for 1 or tests for 0 etc)
-	Argument parsing from 65C816 to optimize two cases
	- push of register var
	- push of LREF (pass r15 = offset, get lref push and return) - want
	  for 65C816 too
-	plusplusc is probably not worth it
-	Track regpairs for r4/r6/r8/r10 and use them as well when loading
	r14/r15
-	Optimize in size mode

	T_DEREF(T_PLUS(T_LREF, T_CONSTANT), r)
	T_EQ(T_PLUS(T_LREF, T_CONSTANT), r)
	to
		right into AC
		ld r15,#n
		call __drfgargr%up
		.word off

	replacing the whole ld r15,#n,call____garg, add, adc, ld r14, ld r15
	etc mess

DONE	end of func jp xx for __exit2,3,4,5,6,7,8.... (and optimize the return n to use it
	too)

	__cpluseq1 __cpluseq2 __cpluseq4 // ditto for char helpers

DONE	Clean up stack in called fn except vararg ?




Would leave us two table type slots free (one if we don't do fold as well)

8080
-	Import Z80 trick for locals via DE


	shld %1
	shld %2
	lhld %1		but volatiles...

	mvi l,0
	mov a,l
=
	xra a
	mov l,a

(and look at removing surplus writes to l in those cases)

	push h
	pop h
	push h
=
 	push h ?

	xchg
	call __cmpne  | __cmpeq

	remove the xchg as de/hl is same as hl/de
	others invert logic and remove xchg

- Z80 find why asm blew up for (ix) not (ix + 0)
- Optimise compares to 0 and FFFF on 8080/5 with
  mov a,h ana l  and mov a,h ora l ??
  and sbc hl,de on z80  - these all need the flags only bits
- keep a volatile count of in context volatiles and some short arrays of names of volatiles
  in scope so we can do basic volatiles as well as casting style
- spot conditionals that are if (simple) and turn them into some kind of FLAGSONLY node so that
  we can optimize simple conditions and avoid bool calls (eg ora a jz)
	- set a FLAGONLY on the top node of the conditional in an if/while/.., then if we see a
	  condition with FLAGONLY we can optimize it in the target
		for stuff like if (*p) we can spot the boolc with FLAGSONLY and optimise it to
		stuff like ld a,h or l and ld a,l or a (and peep can fix some of the other bits)
  [Part done CCONLY exists now to use it more]

- Switch optimizer
- Optimizer options so can switch between cheap, full and add on stuff like rst hooks
- register arguments (some way to pass the info and then generate a subtree
    EQ REG regvar DEREF ARGUMENT n to initialize it)
- hash array and function type lookup
- hash name lookup
- rewrite x = x + .. and x = x -... etc as += -=
- Turn the frame the other way up ?
- Track register state on backend
- Fix up the canonical and array decay - check decay to array type
- Have O_ op table tight packed and rerite T_ into O_ entries, then have a property table
  for them (memread, memwrite, modworking, sideffect, setcc, communtatitve)
  (rewrite is easy - directly code the ops with the right bits so T_ = O_ except
  for the ones based on the ascii. Pack those tight and use a 256 byte lookup)
- Can we tag the presence of volatile somehow. It is rare so we could just
  remember if volatile appeared in a cast anywhere in the expression and assume
  badness, and also keep a small table of names that are volatile (eg keep
  10 sym ptrs for global and for local ?)
- Other volatile option, is to pass a volatile marker on expression trees if
  a volatile cast appears or a local is marked volatile. Globals are a bit
  tricker that way ? (in progress)
- 8085 - load byte vars by word loading the right offset and ignoring one.
- Eliminate assignment to self ?
- Pass "no &local used in this function" for optimization hints (means local
  writes don't invalidate mem which for many reg processors with tracking is
  really important)

Broken 
-	need to switch how we handle -ve numbers to fix -32768 problem but also
	stuff like negative floats. In check for MINUS/PLUS we need to look for
	-ve constant and if so invert it and re-insert a fake MINUS token
	(Other plan -
		unambiguous minus is T_NEGATE
		ambiguious generate T_NEGMAYBE then the value. If we are
		expecting a uni op then we parse it as T_NEGATE. If we
		were expecting a value we throw it and negate the following
		constant)
-	Fix
		{ int n; { long n; } } - need to know if we are creating new sym level
-	Fix
	void (*p)(void); void x(void);   if (p == x) - bad type (&x works)
-	Why is  if (++x) of char generating a castc before the cmpeq ?

Longer term
- fix ptrdiff_t matches INT assumption
- backend hooks for building stack frame via initializers
- literal based handling for some types (set by target) - eg double/longlong
  so that we pass pointers around including one to a memory "register". 
  &x will need care as do casts
- do we want to go to some kind of table rule parsing model over the
  current code based one ?
- look at some kind of simple register assignment rewriting so that 6803/6809
  etc can try and rewrite some subtrees to use an index register, and maybe
  also eliminate the push case for some of those
- simple register tracking helper library
- rewrite && and || and maybe ?: so that we don't have
  (AND (BOOL (x)) (BOOL(y))) but some kind of
  BOOL(AND(CC(x) CC(y))) and work on condition code plus a tidy if needed so
  that we can have ccode setting trees that drop the top bool if the CC is
  ok. - IP partly done but need to sort branch trees out to get best result

- 6809 - use pshs/puls as a sneaky tight way to mod the stack
- Optimizer pass for tree rearrangement ?
PARTDONE - Whilst we need to be careful for side effects on * 0, we don't for and/or
  subtrees with && || so should deal with those
- cc0 and the -32768 funny (understand a little of previous token is needed)
- native compile support for machines where a pointer is a native long type. Cross
  is going to be fine usually
- Write tree size before each expr and load and chain multiple trees if room
  Does need care handling any extra header stuff in the way.
- Can we walk the subtrees looking for the most repeated left/right expensive
  refs (ie locals on 8080 or Z80) and rewrite the tree so the most common is
  in say BC, then rewrite subtree with REG and a load/put of the reg
- 8080 pass first argument in HL, so defer final push before func call. Then
  can xthl push hl to get stack in order, and do cleanup of all args on
  the return path instead of caller - would need vararg help for cleanup ?
- 8080 rewrite  SHL(constant 1, by n) into a 1 << n node so we can gen a
  fast 1 << n (lookup table ?)
DONE - Walk subtrees of logic ops to try and optimize bools if value not used and subnodes just
  need cc
- Turn !! (NOT NOT) into BOOL
